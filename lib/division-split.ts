/**
 * Splitting a big division into a younger and an older bracket (site issue #81). Pure, so the
 * rule is tested without a database; the numbers come from the ages (on contest day) of the
 * division's paid entrants.
 *
 * Rule: at or below `above` entrants, one division. Above it, split only if both brackets would
 * have at least `minBracket` players. `minBracket` is a floor only: a bracket can be as large as it
 * needs (5 and 40 is a fine split), so brackets are never capped or balanced. The suggested cut leans toward a natural line (the biggest
 * jump in ages between neighbouring players, e.g. kids vs adults) and, between equal gaps, the
 * cut nearest the mean age. The organizer decides; this only suggests and previews.
