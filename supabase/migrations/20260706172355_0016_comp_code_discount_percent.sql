comment on column contest_comp_codes.discount_percent is
  'Percent off the registration fee when this code is applied (1-100). 100 = fully comped ($0 due, skips Stripe checkout). Anything less still goes through Stripe for the discounted amount.';

-- Retire the initial seeded codes (VOLUNTEER26, SPONSOR26, FRESHLY_DIRTY_TEAM).
-- Confirmed uses_count = 0 for all three as of 2026-07-06 — safe to delete
