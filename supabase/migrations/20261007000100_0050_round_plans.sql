-- 0050: confirmed round plans (site issue #80)
--
-- A division with a `roundPlan` in contest.config.ts runs different rounds depending on how many
-- entered (e.g. 25 or fewer: final only; 26-50: prelims then final; more: prelims, semi-final,
-- final). When registration closes the app suggests a plan from the paid entrant count and an
-- organizer confirms it here. Until a division has a row, every configured round counts, so
-- this is purely additive and changes nothing for divisions without a plan.
--
-- `rounds` is the confirmed plan: [{ "round": 1, "key": "prelims", "advance": 15 }, ...].
-- Round numbers are positions in the division's configured rounds; skipped rounds keep theirs.
