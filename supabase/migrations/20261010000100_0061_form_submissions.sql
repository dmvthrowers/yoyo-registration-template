-- 0061: answers to the forms on our own system (additive; build plan 5.1, docs/FORMS.md)
--
-- One table for every form described in contest.config.ts (`contest.forms`). `answers` holds the cleaned answers
-- keyed by field id, so adding a field to a form needs no migration. The public form posts through the API,
-- never straight to the table; only the service role reads and writes it, and staff see rows through the API
-- (capability `forms.review`). Rows can hold personal details: set a retention rule before collecting anything
-- sensitive (docs/SEASON_ARCHIVE.md). Nothing is deleted by this migration.
