-- 0042: one music track per division per player (expand step)
--
-- Until now a registration had a single music slot (contest_registrations.music_path / music_filename),
-- so a player in 1A + X uploaded for their first division and a second upload replaced it.
-- This adds contest_music: one row per (registration, division). Purely additive:
--   * the old music_* columns stay as they are and the app stops reading them. A later
--     "contract" migration drops them once this has run through a contest.
--   * contest_registrations.music_uploaded_at is kept up to date by a trigger as "has at least one
--     real (non lo-fi) track", so the admin list and its Music filter keep working.
--
-- Backfill: each existing track is filed under the division in its file name
-- (DIVISION_Last_First.ext), falling back to the player's first division.
