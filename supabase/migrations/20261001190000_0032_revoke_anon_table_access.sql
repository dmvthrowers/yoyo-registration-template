-- 0032: the public anon key must not read registrant data
--
-- Every public table had the default Supabase grants (anon and authenticated
-- could SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE every column), so RLS was the only gate.
-- Four "public_can_view_*" SELECT policies open rows to anon:
--   contest_registrations (paid AND is_public), contest_spectators (is_public),
--   contest_staff_accounts (is_active AND is_public_profile), contest_event_flags.
-- Because the grants covered every column, anyone holding the anon key (it
-- ships in the browser bundle) could run
--   GET /rest/v1/contest_registrations?select=email,phone,parent_email,...
-- and read email, phone, emergency contacts, parent details, IP address,
-- admin notes and music upload tokens for every public competitor, including
-- minors, plus spectator emails and IPs.
--
-- The app never reads these tables with the anon or authenticated role:
-- every query goes through createAdminClient() (service role, bypasses RLS
-- and grants), and the browser client is used for auth only. So drop all
-- table and view privileges for anon and authenticated. The RLS policies stay
-- in place as a second layer.
