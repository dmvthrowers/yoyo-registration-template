# Migrations

Each file is named `<version>_<name>.sql`, where `<version>` is the exact
version recorded in production's `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`
for that migration. Supabase decides what is "already applied" by
`version` alone, so the filename timestamp must match production. A
mismatched timestamp makes an applied migration look unapplied to
`supabase db push` / branching.

Already applied to production, never rename or edit these files. Add new
migrations with a new timestamp (`supabase migration new <name>`, or the
`apply_migration` tool, which records the version for you), then make sure
the committed filename uses the version production recorded.

## Why the `00NN` labels aren't sequential

The `00NN_` part of each name is just a label, kept as production recorded
it. Supabase never reads it. Known quirks:

- **Two `0017`s**: `0017_public_read_policies_profiles_and_results` and
  `0017_staff_socials` are separate migrations, both applied.
- **No `0024`/`0025`**: those labels were never used; nothing is missing.
- **`0014`/`0015` sort after `0021`**: they were applied to production on
  2026-09-20, after `0021`, and file order follows the real apply order.
- The first six files and `enable_rls_run_order_scores` /
  `contest_survey_responses` predate the `00NN` convention.

Renaming the labels would also mean rewriting production's migration
history, for no functional gain, so they stay as they are.
